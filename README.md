# Loan_Status-_analysis
This analysis is majorly about classifying customers if they get a loan or not based on a number of input values  such as , gender, marriage, education, loan amount etc . we use the random forest algorithm 
the input values have no relationship 
the data is imbalanced , we therefore use the smote() for oversampling to balance for the model to perform well
